# CMPE-273-FinalProject

Components: Java jersey api's, MongoDB

 Implementation of car lane changing and cruise control prototype in Java using Jersey REST api's. The communication between client and server is done with OMA LWM2M protocols

Objective: 

● To build a Lane Changing System as part of the gateway that senses the vehicles around it on the road and safely switches lanes when there is no other vehicle on the lane it is switching to.

● To build a Adaptive Cruise Control System that regulates the speed of the vehicle, i.e, it slows down the vehicle if there is another vehicle ahead of it within the minimum threshold distance. Similarly it must increase the speed if there is another vehicle behind it within the minimum threshold distance.

● To build the gateway using Lightweight Machine to Machine protocol defined as per the OMA Lightweight Machine to Machine Specification.
